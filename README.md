# Sales & Finance Analytics of AtliQ Hardwares

In this project, I took a systematic approach to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the data, followed by solution design and creating connections among tables in data
modeling. With these foundational steps in place, I utilized powerful tools like Pivot Tables and Power Pivot to generate insightful reports.

I tackled some critical business inquiries and gained valuable insights into sales performance and market trends. Here are some highlights from my analysis:

1Ô∏è‚É£ The Top 10 Products: I identified the top 10 products with the highest percentage increase in net sales from 2020 to 2021. üìà These products played a pivotal 
role in driving revenue growth and making a significant impact on the company's success.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Division Report: I generated a comprehensive report that showcased the net sales data for 2020 and 2021, along with the growth percentage. üìä This report helped 
visualize the performance of different divisions within the organization, providing crucial insights for strategic decision-making.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Quantity Sold Rankings: By examining the quantity sold, I determined the top 5 and bottom 5 products in terms of sales volume. üìâ These rankings shed light on 
the key drivers of sales and allowed us to identify opportunities for improvement.

4Ô∏è‚É£ New Product Expansion: I explored the new products introduced by Atliq in 2021.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Countries: Through careful analysis, I discovered the top 5 countries in terms of net sales in 2021. üåç These markets were instrumental in driving our 
global sales performance, and understanding their dynamics helped us tailor our strategies for maximum effectiveness.

Additionally, I delved into our customers' sales performance and market performance versus target.
